 <title>Open House Fall of 2012</title>
 <link>http://loftusheatingandac.com/blog/2012/07/open-house-fall-2012</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; With the recent purchase of the 2 buildings just to the west of our current office we are making some changes and preparing for growth. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The brick building immediately next door is currently being remodeled into new offices which will include two additional offices over what we currently have and a large training room for an expanded in-house training program as well as monthly employee meetings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; We hope to hire a person for inventory management to fill one of the new offices soon after the completion and move.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Set It Back and Save</title>
 <link>http://loftusheatingandac.com/blog/2010/12/set-it-back-and-save</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As the temperatures drop, you may begin to look for ways to keep warm without having high utility bills.&amp;nbsp; One of the easiest ways to keep your heating costs under control is to keep your thermostat set at 68 degrees or lower.&amp;nbsp; At night or when you are away from home, try turning the thermostat down 5 to 10 degrees for more savings.&amp;nbsp; You may want to consider having a programmable thermostat installed that will automatically keep several different setting for different times and days.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>And we think Halloween is spooky</title>
 <link>http://loftusheatingandac.com/blog/2009/10/and-we-think-halloween-spooky</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know about any of you but whatever our politicians are doing these days scares the begeevees out of me.&amp;nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what begeevees are or if I have spelled them right but I know they&#039;ve gotta be scared&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Washington is pushing through bills without reading them and voting on things in secret in the middle of the night to hide in this new health care plan.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; What the heck?&amp;nbsp; Now this stuff is spooky!&amp;nbsp; That&#039;s my take on things for whatever it worth.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Summer 2009</title>
 <link>http://loftusheatingandac.com/blog/2009/09/summer-2009</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the unseasonably cool weather, we have had a very busy summer at Loftus Heating and A/C.&amp;nbsp; For that we are very grateful.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We are coming into the home stretch of the cooling Planned Service which is a bit behind schedule due to the busy summer and more than our share of rainy days which makes scheduling maintenance service impossible.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We thank&amp;nbsp;our customers who we haven&#039;t been to yet&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and those for whom we&amp;nbsp;performed the maintenance&amp;nbsp;later than normal for your patience and understanding.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
